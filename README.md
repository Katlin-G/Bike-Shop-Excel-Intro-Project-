Bike Shop Excel Dashboard Project 
This is my first complete project in 2 years since taking my Data Science Immersion class with Divergence Academy. I wanted to ease my way back into learning Excel, creating dashboards, and pivot tables. What better way than to follow through a tutorial with Alex the Analyst? 

Cleaning the data by removing duplicates, changing abbreviated text back to full text for a simplified (no second guessing what the abbreviation is referring to) read, looking for spelling errors, and adding age brackets. The next step was to build three pivot tables that included information about the average income of the buyers and non-buyers for bikes, income change, commuting distance, and the age brackets of customers buying bikes. Filters were added to provide more information such as married vs single buyers, buyers' region, and educational background.
